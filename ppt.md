At Onout, we believe that the key to success is offering value to our customers. That's why we have adopted a revenue share model for our software, where we take a percentage of the revenue generated by the end user as a result of using our software. However, customers have the option to buy a version without any fees at any time.

With this model, we are able to align our revenue with the value our software provides to the customer, ensuring that we are only earning revenue from those who are actively using our product and generating value from it. This model also makes our software more accessible to customers who may only use it infrequently, as they are not required to pay upfront. And for those who prefer to pay upfront, the option to buy a version without any fees is always available.

This revenue share model offers several key benefits, including aligned revenue with user value, increased adoption and usage, better understanding of customer needs, and greater flexibility in our pricing strategy. These benefits can help drive growth for your business and increase customer satisfaction.
